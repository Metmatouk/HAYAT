# HAYAT

A project called ***HA.YA.T (Disease Detection Using Software) based on convolutional-like neural networks.***

Me and my team participated in the ***"Tübitak 2204-A Inter-Hıgh School Project Competetion".*** ***Then we achieved 4th place at "Technological Design" category;***

## Project Details

### Abstract : 
   Walking is a chain of repeated rhythmic movements to get from one place to another. The way individuals walk plays a critical role in the diagnosis of many orthopedic, rheumatological, and neurodegenerative health issues; however, patients encounter various difficulties during the diagnosis of these health problems. HAYAT (Detection of Diseases with Software) is a comprehensive system that brings together software and mechanical components designed to minimize these challenges, prevent patients from becoming dependent on hospitals, and shorten the diagnosis and treatment duration of diseases with gait disorders while increasing efficiency. Electrotab, Electrokas, Electronab, Electroimu devices are designed to be compatible with wearable technologies, taking patient comfort into consideration. Our devices detect patients' walking data in the best possible way and send it to our mobile application. As a result of the analysis of the submitted data using machine learning algorithms, the patient's medical health status is determined. After the diagnoses made by artificial intelligence are approved by the doctor, customized treatment methods are offered for each patient. While the treatment methods are applied by the patient, the process is recorded through cameras, and the analysis of the recorded footage using an image processing system determines the impact and efficiency of the treatment on the patient's body. All the obtained data is displayed in a three-dimensional environment through simulation, and the values taken from the patient are analyzed in real-time and presented to the patient in the form of updated table graphics. According to all the analyses and evaluations conducted, solutions are being offered for the patient's subsequent treatment stages. After the prototypes were made, our products and systems were subjected to simulation, sensor measurement quality, and machine learning accuracy tests. As a result of the tests conducted, it has been determined that our products and systems have very high accuracy rates and are very close to medical results. In conclusion, HAYAT is a new and evolving system for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases where gait disorders are a symptom.
